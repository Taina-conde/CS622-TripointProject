# Tripoint : A Points System for Credit Cards

This project concerns a points system for credit card purchases. 
The users accumulate points by making purchases with their credit cards. 
The point value depends on the credit card they used, and the category of 
the purchase (dining, travel, online shopping, and grocery). For every purchase
the user makes, the system collects information about the credit card used and 
the category of the purchase, and then calculates the points earned and adds 
them to the overall sum of points in the userâ€™s account. The goal of the user 
is to eventually redeem these points for travel. This points system will be 
called Tripoint.
